Each Customer has Address , 
Address can be office, res

Amit â€”> Address
Office , res
Office address can be N But Unique
Res Address can be N But Unique

Customer also has Orders , Orders are N and Order are access BY Id, Order Contains Product, Product can be N, Product are sorted by Prices.
Product can be Duplicate.
Also Print Summary Report - Total Amount of Product.
